0 This file contains texts, with space allowed, that are loaded and used.
0
0 They are structured as:
0
0    <Identity Number>    <Ignored - can use for small comments>
0<target text> <Ending sequence of non-space characters> <Ignored until next ID>
0
0
0 They are loaded as follows:
0
0 1) Any content is ignored until a space-enclosed number is detected.
0
0 2) If the detected number is 0 then the line that follows is ignored.
0
0 3) If the detected number is 1 then the first sequence
0    of non-space characters which follows is loaded.
0    Then we go to step 1 and detect the next number.
0
0 4) Any content until the first encounter of a newline is ignored.
0
0 5) If the detected number is a valid Identity Number
0    as specified by the software provider, then
0    extraction starts from just after the newline.
0    If not then we go to step 1 and detect the next number.
0
0 5) Extraction stops when the End_Of_Text sequence of non-space
0    characters, as specified by Indenty Number 1, is detected.
0    Then we go to step 1 and detect the next number.
0
0 Note: The place-holders are specified using: \<number>.
0       For example \1 means: give special meaning to the number 1.
0       This special meaning is: the place-holder for the first argument.
0       Here the 1st, 2nd and 3rd arguments are the file, line and column.
0
0 Note: If an Identity Number is not found then the default setting,
0       as built in the software, is used. This setting is actually
0       the original version of this file as given by the software.
